# Exact custom workflow topology

Use this path whenever the user explicitly names the required nodes and dependencies. A matching
production Skill does not turn an exact topology request into the normal draft flow.

1. Load exactly one matching workflow Skill with `freezone_get_workflow_skill(compact=true)`.
2. Author one complete `freezone_workflow_plan.v1` using only that Skill's allowed node capabilities
   and Recipe IDs returned in `available_recipes`.
3. Every executable node must contain an explicit `data.workflowCatalog.recipeId`. Input/resource
   text nodes may omit a Recipe when they only carry user-provided material.
4. Put all nodes and semantic edges in the same plan. Use logical plan IDs only; the compiler turns
   them into same-batch `client_id` values.
5. Call `freezone_create_workflow_graph` once. It deterministically adds grouping, layout, selection,
   and one canvas batch.

The user's imperative to create or run authorizes this protected write submission. Do not ask for a
second create/run confirmation. The graph call emits the approval surface; in `auto_execute`, the
host applies the ordinary approval event automatically after required media parameters are known.

Do not call `freezone_emit_canvas_command` for this path. Do not separately create nodes, edges,
groups, or layout after the graph call.
