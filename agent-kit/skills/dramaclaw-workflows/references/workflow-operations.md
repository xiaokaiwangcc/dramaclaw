# Backend workflow operations

`freezone_prepare_workflow` takes exactly one `intent` or `plan`, the admitted `operation_id`,
required boolean `run_after_create`, and optional `bindings`. A terse confirmation inherits this
decision from the immediately preceding proposal. It returns the persisted identity, revision,
digest, preview and next action, not the full compiled graph. It does not execute the canvas.

For an exact `plan`, shared generation controls may use these stable portable names under
`plan.inputs`; preparation applies them to every matching media node. The same names are also
accepted under node `data` for step-local pins:
`image_model`, `image_aspect_ratio`, `image_resolution`, `image_quality`,
`image_variants_per_node`, `video_model`, `video_aspect_ratio`, `video_resolution`,
`video_duration_seconds`, `video_generate_audio`, `video_generation_mode`, and
`video_variants_per_node`. Preparation converts them to the canvas runtime fields before validation
and persistence. The shorter semantic setting names used by revision are also accepted under node
`data` during exact plan preparation. Shared `plan.inputs` values only fill fields a node leaves
unset: an explicit node pin (either spelling) wins over the shared value. Two aliases for the same
setting with different values on one node are still rejected; the server never silently chooses
between them.

`video_generation_mode` is the exception to "the node wins": it records the mode the user asked
for, and modes are not interchangeable (`imageToVideo` uses the image as a whole-picture
reference, `firstFrame` locks it as the opening frame). State the mode as the shared
`video_generation_mode`; a video node `genMode` that differs from it blocks the draft with
`video_generation_mode_conflict`, and a node `genMode` with no shared mode blocks it with
`video_generation_mode_unconfirmed`. A single shot may differ only through a
`freezone_revise_workflow` step update of `generation_mode`, which the server records for that node
outside the plan; a `confirmedInputs.video_generation_mode` inside any plan (including a draft
stored earlier) is never treated as a confirmation. When a
model rejects the mode (`model_capability_unsupported` on `genMode`), keep the mode and switch to
one of the returned `compatible_models`; if there are none, ask the user.

Bindings refer to existing plan node IDs:

```json
{"source":"brief","target":"image","usage":"prompt","prompt":"Actual generation prompt"}
```

Usage is `prompt`, `context`, `reference`, `dependency`, or `composition`. A planning/context
source used as a generation prompt requires actual prompt text: the backend creates a separate
`input_text` node and the two typed edges. It never changes the source's semantic role, invents
prompt content, removes existing edges, or relaxes exact-count constraints. Invalid existing edges
must be corrected in the complete source plan. Documentation-only content should be grouped with
its generator rather than connected as a prompt.

`freezone_revise_workflow` takes `draft_id`, integer `expected_revision`, and `changes`:

- Compact intent: only changed intent fields (`inputs` merges; optional null fields are removed).
- Exact plan: `step_updates` and/or `bindings`. A step update contains `node_id`, optional `prompt`,
  and optional `settings`. Settings include supported model, aspect_ratio, resolution, quality,
  duration_seconds, generate_audio, generation_mode, variants, or voice_ref for that node type.
  Existing custom voice and generation-parameter rules still apply. Do not mix these changes with
  compact intent fields.

All edits are revalidated before a compare-and-swap revision update. Unknown fields and invalid
edges are rejected without modifying the stored draft. A revision conflict requires reading and
reviewing current state; do not blindly retry with the new revision.

`freezone_get_workflow` returns compact draft/confirmation state. `submitted` and `confirming`
mean await receipt. `confirmed` means canvas confirmation, not completed media generation; inspect
the workflow run for media completion. Do not repeat preparation or confirmation after a timeout.


Preparation, revision, and confirmation all recheck live model capabilities on the backend.
The authenticated request identity selects the catalog. Unsupported parameters or unavailable
catalogs block explicit model requests; fix the reported fields without changing user requirements.
Missing live queue information is advisory; execution admission still enforces queue limits.

`freezone_observe_workflow_run` accepts `run_id`, optional `wait_seconds` (0–20), and optional `after`
(the previous `observation_token`). It reconciles durable tasks and artifact evidence, then returns
progress, counts, terminal state, and per-node recovery decisions. Bounded waiting reduces agent
polling; this is not a continuously running background scheduler.

Transient query failures may be retried as reads of the same run. An ambiguous generation timeout
requires reconciliation before any retry. `retry_after_confirmation` requires authorization and the
existing runner's resume path. Observation never enqueues media, overrides a runner lease, confirms
an approval, or repeats paid generation. Preserve the returned recovery decision rather than
inferring retries from raw error text. A terminal run must not be polled indefinitely.
