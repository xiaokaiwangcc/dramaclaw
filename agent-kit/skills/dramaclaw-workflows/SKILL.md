# DramaClaw Workflows

Build one coherent workflow transaction, not a sequence of standalone canvas edits.

## Required behavior

- Read this Skill and its references only through the exact locator advertised by the current host.
  Never invent `project://` paths. Use a canvas summary already supplied by the host; if current
  canvas data must be refreshed, call `freezone_get_canvas_ontology` instead of inventing a
  `canvas://` resource. MCP clients must use only resource URIs returned by `resources/list` or
  `resources/templates/list`.
- Use the portable `dramaclaw-workflows` MCP server for catalog discovery and deterministic
  compilation when it is available. Use the authorized DramaClaw MCP server for draft persistence,
  approval, canvas commit, and execution. Tool names are host-neutral; call them through the MCP
  mechanism supported by the current agent.
- `dramaclaw-workflows` is this Agent Skill package/server name, not a Workflow catalog `skill_id`.
  Never pass it to `workflow_skill_get`, `freezone_get_workflow_skill`, or an intent's `skill_id`.
  Select the matching production Workflow Skill returned by the catalog instead.
- Never implement a multi-node request by repeatedly calling `freezone_create_node`,
  `freezone_create_edge`, `freezone_group_nodes`, or other single-operation tools.
- Never fall back to repeated single-operation writes after a workflow validation or schema error.
  Correct the workflow intent/plan or report the blocking error.
- A failure from an earlier chat turn is diagnostic history, not proof that the current adapter is
  still blocked. When the user repeats the original create/run request, explicitly asks to retry,
  or has restarted the service, retry the same complete workflow write once in the current turn.
  Never declare the current environment blocked without a same-turn write result showing the same
  failure.
- A confirmed workflow must be committed as one operation and must produce one approval surface.
- The deterministic workflow compiler owns node IDs, same-batch references, grouping, layout,
  selection, and the final `canvas_chat_commands.v1` batch.
- An explicit imperative to create or run authorizes submission to the protected canvas write tool.
  Do not ask for a duplicate create/run confirmation and do not claim that the host cannot display
  the approval surface; the write tool emits it. In `auto_execute`, the host applies the ordinary
  approval event after required image/video parameters are known.
- Use `freezone_request_user_clarification` for structured questions. Never substitute a host's
  built-in `request_user_input`, `update_plan`, or `create_goal` for canvas work.

## Route the request

Before creating a draft or graph that will actually run image or video generation, inspect the
user request, selected Recipe input contract, existing target-node data, and the host-provided
canvas execution mode. For every new generation request, call
`freezone_request_user_clarification` exactly once before any canvas write in both
`manual_confirm` and `auto_execute`. Historical clarification answers, prior-turn parameters,
existing node values, and Recipe defaults may prefill recommended choices, but never count as the
user's selection for the current request. After the clarification result returns for that request,
do not ask again.

- In `manual_confirm`, apply the preliminary answers to the plan, then submit the protected write.
  The normal approval card is still shown and remains the final parameter editor.
- In `auto_execute`, apply the preliminary answers and submit the protected write immediately. A
  normal approval event is still emitted and may be auto-applied. Explicit human-review
  requirements may still pause execution.
- If the host does not provide a valid mode, treat it as `manual_confirm`.

The image/video choices are:

- Image: model preference, aspect ratio, resolution/quality, and variants per node.
- Video: model or generation mode, aspect ratio, resolution, duration, sound generation, and output
  variants per node.

Do not include audio voice-source selection in this preliminary clarification. Never ask the user
to choose system voice versus custom voice. A speech node uses an already selected custom
`voiceRef`; if none is selected, its generation is skipped as defined under Execution and
completion.

Offer a recommended/default option so the user does not need to understand provider-specific
fields. In either execution mode, do not draft, commit, approve, or run until the required
clarification result returns. This is an explicit exception to a host's general rule not to ask about model
parameters. It applies only to image and video generation for now, and only when the operation will
generate media (including `run_after_create=true`); do not ask when the user only wants empty nodes,
connections, grouping, layout, or edits without generation. Choices explicit in the current user
request, Recipe, existing node data, or history should be preselected in the card, not used to skip
the card.

The portable workflow intent carries confirmed shared choices in `inputs`:

```json
{
  "image_model": "<catalog model id>",
  "image_aspect_ratio": "16:9",
  "image_resolution": "2K",
  "image_quality": "medium",
  "image_variants_per_node": 1,
  "video_model": "<catalog model id>",
  "video_aspect_ratio": "16:9",
  "video_resolution": "720P",
  "video_duration_seconds": 5,
  "video_generate_audio": false,
  "video_variants_per_node": 1
}
```

`image_count` and `video_count`, when declared by a selected Skill, describe workflow deliverable
or node counts. Never use them as per-node generation counts. Only
`image_variants_per_node` / `video_variants_per_node` map to canvas node `data.count`, and their
portable supported values are `1`, `2`, and `4`.

Use only the image or video keys relevant to the selected plan. For an exact custom topology, put
the equivalent canvas fields directly in every generated node's `data`. If a write returns
`code="generation_parameters_required"`, do not retry unchanged. Call
`freezone_request_user_clarification` once for all returned missing choices, apply the current
request's answers to the same intent/plan, and retry the same operation. Approval behavior remains
controlled by the execution mode.

If the user selects a recommended/default image or video model, use the symbolic value
`"recommended"` in the portable intent input or the media node's `data.model`. It is a user
preference, not a catalog model id; the authorized adapter resolves it through the frontend's live
default immediately before commit. Never invent a model id, and never rebuild a complete graph just
to replace the symbolic recommendation after a failed write.

Generation clarification must use one question per missing portable field; never combine model,
ratio, resolution, duration, sound, or count into a single recommended-settings preset. Read the
live node create schema once for each relevant image/video node type and use its exact options. A
`video_resolution` question must expose every resolution supported by the selected/live model,
including `480P` whenever the schema lists it.

1. Identify the single matching workflow Skill from the user's explicit goal. Use
   `workflow_catalog_search(kind="skills")` when discovery is needed. If several materially
   different Skills match, ask the user to choose; do not guess.
2. Read the selected package with `workflow_skill_get`, or with
   `freezone_get_workflow_skill` when the standalone server is unavailable. Use only
   the returned Recipe summaries and input contract.
3. Call `freezone_begin_agent_product_generation` with `product_kind="workflow_result"`, a stable
   generation session, `skill_id`, `skill_version`, `artifact_id="<skill_id>@<skill_version>"`,
   and the normalized inputs before authoring the result. These Skill identities must match the
   later compiled result.
4. For a normal workflow, submit one compact `freezone_workflow_intent.v1` and the admitted
   `operation_id` to `freezone_prepare_workflow_draft`.
5. Present the returned preview. Adjust it only with `freezone_patch_workflow_draft`.
6. After explicit user confirmation, call `freezone_confirm_workflow_draft` once with the exact
   `draft_id` and `revision`.

When the user explicitly names the required nodes and their dependency order, use the exact topology
path in [references/custom-topology.md](references/custom-topology.md), preparing the complete Plan
as a persisted draft even when a production Skill
also matches. For error recovery, read
[references/error-recovery.md](references/error-recovery.md).

When packaging this Skill for another agent host, read
[references/integration.md](references/integration.md).

## Execution and completion

- When graph creation or draft confirmation uses `run_after_create=true`, its approved batch already
  contains the only `run_workflow` request. Do not call `freezone_run_workflow` again in the same
  turn. Start another run only after a terminal failure and a later explicit user retry.
- To continue or resume an existing workflow, call `freezone_run_workflow`; do not traverse and run
  nodes individually.
- Freezone speech uses custom/reference voices only; never select or generate with a preset/system
  voice. Preserve an existing valid `voiceRef`. If no valid custom voice is selected, skip that
  audio node without submitting TTS and continue the remaining workflow. Never select the first
  available voice automatically or open `open_voice_picker` unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Treat `awaiting_approval`, `accepted`, and `running` as non-final states. Do not claim that canvas
  creation or generation completed until the corresponding result says it did.
- Use `operation_id`, `draft_id`, `revision`, and returned idempotency identifiers unchanged on
  retries. Never create a replacement draft merely because delivery was retried.
