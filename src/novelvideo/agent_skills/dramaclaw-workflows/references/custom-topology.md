# Exact custom workflow topology

Use this path when the user explicitly names required nodes and dependencies that deviate from the
matching Skill's standard template. A matching production Skill does not turn a genuinely custom
topology request into the normal draft flow. An explicit planner instruction takes priority over
this heuristic: when the user names the standard planner or the Skill's standard flow and the
listed nodes merely restate that template (same stages, order, and dependencies), stay on the
normal Intent path; when the instruction and the listed topology conflict, ask one single-question
clarification first (see the routing order in SKILL.md). The server applies the same comparison:
a custom plan that turns out to restate the template is compiled by the standard planner
(`planner.selected_by = template_isomorphic`) when, and only when, that compilation reproduces
the plan node for node, and the plan's own nodes are carried over as written; anything the
standard units cannot express (a clip reading another
unit's frame, a frame brief that differs from its clip brief, a different Recipe or voice
setting, music without voice-over, a reference note feeding the outline, a custom compose
order) stays an agent-authored draft with the difference recorded in
`planner.template_match.reason`.

1. Load exactly one matching production Workflow Skill. Prefer
   `workflow_skill_get(skill_id=...)` on the standalone workflow MCP server; that reader is always
   compact. When the standalone server is unavailable, use
   `freezone_get_workflow_skill(skill_id=...)`.
2. Author one complete `freezone_workflow_plan.v1` using only that Skill's allowed node capabilities
   and Recipe IDs returned in `available_recipes`.
   The top level must always include both
   `schema_version: "freezone_workflow_plan.v1"` and
   `skill: {"id":"<selected skill_id>","version":"<selected skill_version>"}`. Copy these
   identities from the loaded production Workflow Skill and keep them identical to the admitted
   operation. `generation_answers` supplements this complete Plan; it never replaces the Plan or
   either required identity field.
   Existing-story image batches are a supported exception: with `text-to-image-video`, a real
   `source_context.story_id`, and every image mapped exactly once across `asset_targets` and
   `targets`, the saved story supplies planning and video destinations. Include only new images
   and optional recipe-less input briefs; keep video nodes outside the Plan. For character,
   product or scene references, read the `interactive-story` Skill's
   `references/reference-images.md` for a complete example and live-asset checks. If this image
   batch reports `skill_stage_missing`, repair its mapping or extraneous executable nodes;
   never add planning/video stages to satisfy that error.
   For other workflows, when the Skill has a standard planner, `planning_contract.standard_planner.stages` lists its
   stages; every stage marked `required` must appear in a custom plan too (for example the
   shot-planning stage of a short drama). A node fills a stage when it has that stage's
   `node_type` and either sets `stage` to the stage id or uses one of the stage's `recipes`.
   `standard_planner.edges` lists which stage's output the next stage consumes (for example
   `shots` → `video`): every node of the downstream stage must be reachable from a node of the
   upstream stage through consuming edges (`prompt_for`, `context_for`, `media_input_for`, ...);
   `dependency_for` only orders execution and does not count. A draft missing a required stage
   is not `ready`: its preflight reports
   `code="skill_stage_missing"` naming the stage; a stage node that nothing downstream consumes
   reports `code="skill_stage_unused"` with the bypassed node ids. Add the node and feed the
   downstream nodes from it, or use the standard planner instead.
   Node prompts are short task briefs, not final production prompts. Describe the node's task and
   which actual upstream outputs/reference assets it must consume. Do not prewrite generated
   scripts, shot-by-shot storyboards, dialogue, or camera/sound details. Preserve user-supplied
   content and constraints; execution-time Recipe compilation produces the executable prompt.
   Author semantic Plan fields only. Do not construct `canvas_chat_commands.v1` yourself: the graph
   compiler owns command defaults, stable IDs, layout, grouping, and final static command validation.
   Use only canonical `node_type` for each node's portable kind. The public MCP contract rejects
   the legacy canvas-command alias `type` and all unknown top-level fields.
   Keep input/resource `stage` at node level. The stage names `input`, `resource`, and `asset` are
   reserved for recipe-less user-provided text/resource nodes. A recipe-backed
   `textAnnotationNode` is executable and must not use those reserved stage names; use the matching
   executable stage from the loaded Skill's planning contract or omit `stage` when it is optional.
   Use only canonical `link_type` on edges.
3. Every executable node must contain an explicit `data.workflowCatalog.recipeId`. Input/resource
   text nodes may omit a Recipe when they only carry user-provided material, but they must set
   `stage` to `input`, `resource`, or `asset`. Those reserved stages and a Recipe are mutually
   exclusive on a `textAnnotationNode`. A terminal `videoComposeNode` has no Recipe.
   Put executable options inside `data` as well; do not place them beside `id`/`node_type`.
   For example, a background-music node must use this shape (with the actual Recipe returned by
   the selected Skill):

   ```json
   {
     "id": "bgm",
     "node_type": "audioNode",
     "data": {
       "workflowCatalog": {"recipeId": "general-audio"},
       "audioKind": "music",
       "text": "无歌词、纯音乐的背景氛围配乐"
     }
   }
   ```

   Do not use ad-hoc top-level fields such as `audioKind`, `musicLengthMs`, `forceInstrumental`,
   or `respectSectionsDurations`; if supported by the live node schema, put them under `data`.
4. Put all new nodes and semantic edges in the same plan. To consume an existing canvas image,
   declare `external_inputs: [{"id":"source_image","node_id":"<existing canvas node id>","media_kind":"image"}]`
   and use `source_image` as the source of a `media_input_for` edge. The server verifies the real
   node and its media at prepare and confirmation. Do not copy the source into `nodes`, put its URL
   in the target data, or include it in `run_workflow` selection. Other references use logical plan
   IDs; the compiler turns new nodes into same-batch `client_id` values.
   Before choosing an edge `link_type`, use the injected compatibility information or call
   `freezone_get_link_type_catalog` once when compatibility is not already explicit. Never guess a
   link type and never trial several link types through repeated compiler calls.
   dependency_for only controls execution order and does not consume the source output. A target
   whose task brief says it uses, follows, continues, adapts, or is based on actual upstream output
   must not use dependency_for for that input. Use `context_for` when a text node consumes upstream
   text as context, `prompt_for` when an image/video/audio/HTML or compatible text step consumes
   upstream text, and `media_input_for` when a target consumes upstream image/video/audio. In
   particular, `textAnnotationNode`/`scriptNode` → `audioNode` must use `prompt_for`, never
   `context_for`. Before
   submission, self-check every claimed upstream input against a consuming edge; preserve
   dependency_for only for a genuine wait where the target remains independent of the source
   output.
   Before submission, treat graph connectivity as an Agent-owned planning invariant rather than a
   detail the user must specify. Traverse the proposed graph as undirected and make sure every node
   belongs to one connected component. When the user's requested units are intentionally independent
   (for example Beats or shots that must fail, skip, and retry without affecting siblings), do not
   chain those units together. Add one non-executable input/root node and fan it out to each unit's
   input node instead. This satisfies whole-plan connectivity while preserving independent execution
   branches. A user does not need to ask for this structural root or name any `link_type`.
5. This path is selected only when the user explicitly requires individual canvas nodes and a
   dependency graph that deviates from the standard template. Beat, shot, episode, duration, or
   deliverable totals alone are standard-planner inputs and must not trigger a raw Plan. Once on
   this path, copy exact canvas-node totals into `expected_node_count` and
   `expected_node_counts`. Counts refer to Plan/business nodes; the generated group node is not
   included. Never lower these expectations to make a partial plan validate.
6. Once a request is on this path because its explicit canvas nodes or dependency order deviate
   from the template, it stays on this full Plan path, including requests above the compact Intent
   planner's item limit. Do not switch to `workflow_intent_compile`, a smaller sample plan, or
   standalone node tools after a validation error. (An explicit standard-planner instruction with a
   template-shaped list never enters this path in the first place; see SKILL.md routing order.)
   Every edge endpoint must match an `id` in `nodes` or a declared external input alias. Never
   invent a source such as `source` or `input` without a matching declaration.
7. Call `freezone_prepare_workflow(plan=...)` once. It strictly validates the complete Plan,
   obtains an operation-bound planning quote and server receipt, then persists an exact preview
   without writing canvas nodes. After the user reviews that preview, call
   `freezone_confirm_workflow_draft` with its exact `draft_id` and `revision`. Do not call
   `workflow_graph_compile` as a routine preflight before preparing the first draft. Use the read-only compiler
   only to diagnose and correct a validation failure. After a recovery compile succeeds, immediately
   prepare that exact corrected Plan with `freezone_prepare_workflow(plan=...)`; do not stop after
   reporting that compilation passed.

The user's imperative does not replace an exact billing confirmation receipt. Follow the quote
response, present the persisted preview, and confirm only the returned draft revision.

Do not call `freezone_emit_canvas_command` for this path. Do not separately create nodes, edges,
groups, or layout after the graph call. Never write placeholder or diagnostic nodes such as `A/B`,
`T1/T2`, or “测试节点” to the user's canvas. If read-only diagnosis is required, pass the same
complete plan to `workflow_graph_compile`; never compile a reduced probe or a multi-node plan with
an empty `edges` array.

For compact Intent submissions, composition policy belongs at `intent.include_compose`
and must not be placed inside `intent.planner`. The planner object contains only its
advertised planning fields; `include_compose` is a sibling of `planner` and `items`.
