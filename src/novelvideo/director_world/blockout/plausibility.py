"""Deterministic plausibility checks on a SceneIR, in the DSL frame.

Vision models that write absolute coordinates tend to produce floating, sunken
or intersecting objects. There is no renderer on the backend, so there is no
render-and-compare loop; these checks are the cheap substitute.

errors    contradict the scene's own conventions. The model gets them back and
          retries.
warnings  look odd but may be intended (a lamp hanging from the ceiling). They
          are recorded and returned to the user, and never trigger a retry.
          A piece that rests on another or hangs on a wall is not floating.

A `scene.room` is open toward the reference camera and closed on the other
three sides, so the picture can only have been taken from between its side
walls and in front of its back wall. A camera anywhere else looks at the back
of a wall, which is an error.

`scene.seen` closes the loop a renderer would: the model writes down where a
piece lies in the picture, the piece is projected through the model's own
camera, and the two must agree. A picture cannot tell a small room seen from
close up from a large one seen from afar, so this does not pin the scale; it
catches the camera, the sizes and the positions contradicting one another.
