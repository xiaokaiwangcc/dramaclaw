"""Counters for the DramaClaw end of the evidence plane.

Every outcome here was already decided on each turn and then kept nowhere. That
is tolerable while a canary is watching; in production it means the three ways
this side can quietly stop working are indistinguishable from low traffic:

- the issuer stops minting capabilities, so nothing is ever attested;
- a turn is refused for want of a credential, so it never egresses at all;
- a worker rotates on every turn, so the per-turn credential bought nothing.

Names and counts only. No key, capability, project, trajectory or prompt — the
whole point is that these are safe to log wherever the process already logs, so
nothing here may carry anything the telemetry allowlist would have to govern.
